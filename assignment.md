### Definitions:

Portfolio Manager: This is a person who is in charge ofs investing money on behalf of other people or organizations. They decide where to put the money to help it grow and manage the risks.
For the purpose of this assignment, you can assume the portfolio manager only invests in the NYSE stock market.
Funds: The portfolio manager uses this money to buy different investments (like stocks or bonds). Each fund usually has a goal or strategy, like focusing on technology stocks or safe government bonds (ie. Multiple tickers per fund).
Holdings: Holdings are simply the individual investments that a fund owns. For example, if a fund buys Apple, Google, and Microsoft stocks, those are its holdings. The holdings show exactly what the fund’s money is invested in.
Peers: A fund may have peers that are managed by other competing firms
You may make any assumptions as long as they’re explained.
