# Prompt 1: Initial Planning

**User Request:**

```
lets create a high level overview for diving into this assignment. lets plan on containerizing with docker. can we use next.js instead of vite for react? I have much more experience with next.js. react, typescript, tailwind and shadcn/ui, zustand and recharts are all excellent choices. lets use fastapi instead of flask. I also think a postgres database is ideal here
