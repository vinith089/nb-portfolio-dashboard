# Prompt 11: Backend API Development

**User Request:**
```
lets build a comprehensive FastAPI backend for a portfolio monitoring dashboard. we need:

1. database models for funds, holdings, stock_prices, fund_performance, and peer_funds
2. API endpoints for full CRUD operations on all entities
3. proper relationships between tables (funds -> holdings, etc.)
4. pydantic schemas for request/response validation
5. async database operations with SQLAlchemy
6. error handling and proper HTTP status codes
7. auto-generated API documentation (fastapi comes with this)

the system should handle:
- fund management (create, read, update, delete funds)
- holdings tracking (individual stock positions within funds)
- performance data (historical NAV and returns)
- peer comparison (benchmarking against other funds)
- stock price data for calculations

we are using postgresql with proper foreign key constraints and indexes
```

**Context:** User needed to build the complete backend API infrastructure for the portfolio monitoring dashboard with comprehensive CRUD operations and proper database relationships.

**Assistant Response:** Created complete FastAPI backend with 5 SQLAlchemy models, 26+ API endpoints across 3 main routers, comprehensive Pydantic schemas for validation, async database operations, proper error handling and status codes, and auto-generated OpenAPI documentation at /docs.

**Outcome:** Fully functional backend API with all necessary endpoints for fund management, holdings tracking, performance data, and peer comparisons.
