# Prompt 14: Performance Charts Implementation

**User Request:**

```
we are using recharts on our dynamic fund page src/app/funds/[id]/page.tsx, we are having issues with the  charts on the performance card showing flat lines and peer comparison only displaying one bar.

lets fix the recharts implementation to:

1. use dual y-axes for different data scales (NAV price vs return percentage)
2. fix the peer comparison chart to show all funds properly
3. handle null/undefined values in the data gracefully
4. make the charts responsive and professional looking
5. add proper legends and tooltips for data clarity

the charts should look like professional financial dashboards with proper data visualization best practices
```

**Context:** User encountered data visualization issues with chart scaling and display problems that were making the performance data appear flat or incomplete.

**Assistant Response:** Fixed performance chart issues by implementing dual Y-axis system for different data scales, fixed peer comparison to display all funds correctly, added null/undefined data handling with proper fallbacks, enhanced chart styling with professional financial theme, and improved responsiveness and tooltip functionality.

**Outcome:** Professional-looking financial charts that properly display performance data with appropriate scaling and complete peer comparison visualization.
